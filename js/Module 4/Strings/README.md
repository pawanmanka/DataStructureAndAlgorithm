 Reverse the given string.

**Q3. Reverse the String**

Problem Description

You are given a string A of size N.


Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

NOTE:

A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.
If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.



Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 3 * 105



Input Format

The only argument given is string A.



Output Format

Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.



Example Input

Input 1:
A = "the sky is blue"
Input 2:
A = "this is ib"


Example Output

Output 1:
"blue is sky the"
Output 2:
"ib is this"    


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
We reverse the string word by word so the string becomes "blue is sky the".
Explanation 2:
We reverse the string word by word so the string becomes "ib is this".

**Q4. Longest Palindromic Substring**

Problem Description

Given a string A of size N, find and return the longest palindromic substring in A.

Substring of string A is A[i...j] where 0 <= i <= j < len(A)

Palindrome string:
A string which reads the same backwards. More formally, A is palindrome if reverse(A) = A.

Incase of conflict, return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index).



Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 6000



Input Format

First and only argument is a string A.



Output Format

Return a string denoting the longest palindromic substring of string A.



Example Input

Input 1:
A = "aaaabaaa"
Input 2:
A = "abba


Example Output

Output 1:
"aaabaaa"
Output 2:
"abba"


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
We can see that longest palindromic substring is of length 7 and the string is "aaabaaa".
Explanation 2:
We can see that longest palindromic substring is of length 4 and the string is "abba".

**Q5. String operations**
Problem Description

Akash likes playing with strings. One day he thought of applying following operations on the string in the given order:

Concatenate the string with itself.
Delete all the uppercase letters.
Replace each vowel with '#'.
You are given a string A of size N consisting of lowercase and uppercase alphabets. Return the resultant string after applying the above operations.

NOTE: 'a' , 'e' , 'i' , 'o' , 'u' are defined as vowels.



Problem Constraints

1<=N<=100000


Input Format

First argument is a string A of size N.



Output Format

Return the resultant string.



Example Input

Input 1:
A="aeiOUz"
Input 2:
A="AbcaZeoB"


Example Output

Output 1:
"###z###z"
Output 2:
"bc###bc###"


Example Explanation

Explanatino 1:
First concatenate the string with itself so string A becomes "aeiOUzaeiOUz".
Delete all the uppercase letters so string A becomes "aeizaeiz".
Now replace vowel with '#', A becomes "###z###z".
Explanatino 2:
First concatenate the string with itself so string A becomes "AbcaZeoBAbcaZeoB".
Delete all the uppercase letters so string A becomes "bcaeobcaeo".
Now replace vowel with '#', A becomes "bc###bc###".

**Q6. Isalnum()**


Problem Description

You are given a function isalpha() consisting of a character array A.





Return 1 if all the characters of a character array are alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, and 0-9) else, return 0.





Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 105



Input Format

Only argument is a character array A.



Output Format

Return 1 if all the characters of the character array are alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z and 0-9), else return 0.



Example Input

 All the characters are NOT alphabets i.e ('#').


**Q1. Longest Common Prefix**

Problem Description

Given the array of strings A, you need to find the longest string S, which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.


The longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 and S2.
