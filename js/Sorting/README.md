**Sorting Basics**

**Q1. Elements Removal**

Problem Description

Given an integer array A of size N. You can remove any element from the array in one operation.
The cost of this operation is the sum of all elements in the array present before this operation.

Find the minimum cost to remove all elements from the array.



Problem Constraints

0 <= N <= 1000
1 <= A[i] <= 103



Input Format

First and only argument is an integer array A.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the total cost of removing all elements from the array.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [2, 1]
Input 2:

 A = [5]


Example Output

Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 5


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Given array A = [2, 1]
 Remove 2 from the array => [1]. Cost of this operation is (2 + 1) = 3.
 Remove 1 from the array => []. Cost of this operation is (1) = 1.
 So, total cost is = 3 + 1 = 4.
Explanation 2:

 There is only one element in the array. So, cost of removing is 5.


 **Q2. Noble Integer**

 Problem Description

Given an integer array A, find if an integer p exists in the array such that the number of integers greater than p in the array equals p.



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 2*105
-108 <= A[i] <= 108


Input Format

First and only argument is an integer array A.



Output Format

Return 1 if any such integer p is present else, return -1.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [3, 2, 1, 3]
Input 2:

 A = [1, 1, 3, 3]


Example Output

Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 -1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 For integer 2, there are 2 greater elements in the array..
Explanation 2:

 There exist no integer satisfying the required conditions.

**Q4. Kth Smallest Element**

Problem Description

Find the Bth smallest element in given array A .

NOTE: Users should try to solve it in less than equal to B swaps.



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 100000

1 <= B <= min(|A|, 500)

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format

The first argument is an integer array A.

The second argument is integer B.



Output Format

Return the Bth smallest element in given array.



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [2, 1, 4, 3, 2]
B = 3
Input 2:

A = [1, 2]
B = 2


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 2


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 3rd element after sorting is 2.
Explanation 2:

 2nd element after sorting is 2.


**Q1. Arithmetic Progression?**

Problem Description

Given an integer array A of size N. Return 1 if the array can be arranged to form an arithmetic progression, otherwise return 0.

A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.



Problem Constraints

2 <= N <= 105

-109 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format

The first and only argument is an integer array A of size N.



Output Format

Return 1 if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression, otherwise return 0.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [3, 5, 1]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 4, 1]


Example Output

Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 We can reorder the elements as [1, 3, 5] or [5, 3, 1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
Explanation 2:

 There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
