**Introduction to Arrays**

**Example : Good Pair**

Problem Description

Given an array A and an integer B. A pair(i, j) in the array is a good pair if i != j and (A[i] + A[j] == B). Check if any good pair exist or not.

Problem Constraints
1 <= A.size() <= 104
1 <= A[i] <= 109
1 <= B <= 109

**Example Q2. Reverse in a range** 
Problem Description

Given an array A of N integers and also given two integers B and C. Reverse the elements of the array A within the given inclusive range [B, C].

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
0 <= B <= C <= N - 1

**Example Q3. Array Rotation**
Problem Description

Given an integer array A of size N and an integer B, you have to return the same array after rotating it B times towards the right.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <=109
1 <= B <= 109

**Example Q6. Second Largest**
Problem Description

You are given an integer array A. You have to find the second largest element/value in the array or report that no such element exists.

Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 105
0 <= A[i] <= 109

**Example Q1. Linear Search - Multiple Occurences**
Problem Description

Given an array A and an integer B, find the number of occurrences of B in A.

Problem Constraints

1 <= B, Ai <= 109
1 <= length(A) <= 105

Input Format

Given an integer array A and an integer B.


Output Format

Return an integer, number of occurrences of B in A.

Example Input

Input 1:
 A = [1, 2, 2], B = 2 
Input 2:
 A = [1, 2, 1], B = 3 

**Example : Q2. Time to equality**

Problem Description

Given an integer array A of size N. In one second, you can increase the value of one element by 1.

Find the minimum time in seconds to make all elements of the array equal.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000000
1 <= A[i] <= 1000

Input Format

First argument is an integer array A.

Output Format

Return an integer denoting the minimum time to make all elements equal.

Example Input

A = [2, 4, 1, 3, 2]

**Q4. Count of elements**

Problem Description

Given an array A of N integers. 
Count the number of elements that have at least 1 elements greater than itself.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
