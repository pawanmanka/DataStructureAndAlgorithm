**Introduction to Arrays**

**Example : Good Pair**

Problem Description

Given an array A and an integer B. A pair(i, j) in the array is a good pair if i != j and (A[i] + A[j] == B). Check if any good pair exist or not.

Problem Constraints
1 <= A.size() <= 104
1 <= A[i] <= 109
1 <= B <= 109

**Example Q2. Reverse in a range** 
Problem Description

Given an array A of N integers and also given two integers B and C. Reverse the elements of the array A within the given inclusive range [B, C].

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
0 <= B <= C <= N - 1

**Example Q3. Array Rotation**
Problem Description

Given an integer array A of size N and an integer B, you have to return the same array after rotating it B times towards the right.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <=109
1 <= B <= 109
