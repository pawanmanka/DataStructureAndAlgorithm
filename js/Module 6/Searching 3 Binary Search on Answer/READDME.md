**Q1. Aggressive cows**

Problem Description

Farmer John has built a new long barn with N stalls. Given an array of integers A of size N where each element of the array represents the location of the stall and an integer B which represents the number of cows.

His cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, John wants to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?



Problem Constraints

2 <= N <= 100000
0 <= A[i] <= 109
2 <= B <= N



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer B.



Output Format

Return the largest minimum distance possible among the cows.



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = 3
Input 2:

A = [1, 2]
B = 2


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 John can assign the stalls at location 1, 3 and 5 to the 3 cows respectively. So the minimum distance will be 2.
Explanation 2:

 The minimum distance will be 1.

**Q2. Painter's Partition Problem**

Problem Description

Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.

Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
NOTE:
1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.

Return the ans % 10000003.



Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 1000
1 <= B <= 106
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= C[i] <= 106



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer A.
The second argument given is the integer B.
The third argument given is the integer array C.



Output Format

Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 2
 B = 5
 C = [1, 10]
Input 2:

 A = 10
 B = 1
 C = [1, 8, 11, 3]


Example Output

Output 1:

 50
Output 2:

 11


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
 Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
 There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
 ans = 50 % 10000003
Explanation 2:

 Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3 
 and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
 ans = 11 % 10000003

**Q3. Special Integer**

Problem Description

Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the maximum value K such that there is no subarray in A of size K with the sum of elements greater than B.



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

1 <= B <= 10^9



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer array A.

The second argument given is integer B.



Output Format

Return the maximum value of K (sub array length).



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = 10
Input 2:

A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
B = 130


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 3


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

For K = 5, There are subarrays [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] which has a sum > B
For K = 4, There are subarrays [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 5] which has a sum > B
For K = 3, There is a subarray [3, 4, 5] which has a sum > B
For K = 2, There were no subarray which has a sum > B.
Constraints are satisfied for maximal value of 2.
Explanation 2:

For K = 4, There are subarrays [5, 17, 100, 11] which has a sum > B
For K = 3, There were no subarray which has a sum > B.
Constraints are satisfied for maximal value of 3.


**Q1. Allocate Books**
Problem Description

Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

The College library has N books. The ith book has A[i] number of pages.

You have to allocate books to B number of students so that the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is minimum.

A book will be allocated to exactly one student.
Each student has to be allocated at least one book.
Allotment should be in contiguous order, for example: A student cannot be allocated book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2.
Calculate and return that minimum possible number.

NOTE: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible.




Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i], B <= 105



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer B.



Output Format

Return that minimum possible number.



Example Input

Input 1:
A = [12, 34, 67, 90]
B = 2
Input 2:
A = [12, 15, 78] 
B = 4


Example Output

Output 1:
113
Output 2:
-1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

There are two students. Books can be distributed in following fashion : 
1)  [12] and [34, 67, 90]
    Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 34 + 67 + 90 = 191 pages
2)  [12, 34] and [67, 90]
    Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 67 + 90 = 157 pages 
3)  [12, 34, 67] and [90]
    Max number of pages is allocated to student 1 with 12 + 34 + 67 = 113 pages
    Of the 3 cases, Option 3 has the minimum pages = 113.
Explanation 2:
Each student has to be allocated at least one book.  
But the Total number of books is less than the number of students.
Thus each student cannot be allocated to atleast one book.

Therefore, the result is -1.
