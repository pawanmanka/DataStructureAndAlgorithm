**Q1. Sorted Insert Position**

Problem Description

You are given a sorted array A of size N and a target value B.
Your task is to find the index (0-based indexing) of the target value in the array.

If the target value is present, return its index.
If the target value is not found, return the index of least element greater than equal to B.
If the target value is not found and least number greater than equal to target is also not present, return the length of array (i.e. the position where target can be placed)
Your solution should have a time complexity of O(log(N)).

**Q1. Minimum Difference**

Problem Description

You are given a 2-D matrix C of size A Ã— B.
You need to build a new 1-D array of size A by taking one element from each row of the 2-D matrix in such a way that the cost of the newly built array is minimized.

The cost of an array is the minimum possible value of the absolute difference between any two adjacent elements of the array.

So if the newly built array is X, the element picked from row 1 will become X[1], element picked from row 2 will become X[2], and so on.

Determine the minimum cost of the newly built array.



Problem Constraints

2 <= A <= 1000
2 <= B <= 1000
1 <= C[i][j] <= 106



Input Format

The first argument is an integer A denoting number of rows in the 2-D array.
The second argument is an integer B denoting number of columns in the 2-D array.
The third argument is a 2-D array C of size A x B.

Return an integer denoting the minimum cost of the newly build array.



Example Input

 A = 3
 B = 2
 C = [ [7, 3]
       [2, 1]
       [4, 9] ]


Example Output

Output 1:

 0
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Newly build array : [8, 8]. The minimum cost will be 0 since the absolute difference will be 0(8-8).
Explanation 2:

 Newly build array : [3, 2, 4]. The minimum cost will be 1 since the minimum absolute difference will be 1(3 - 2).
